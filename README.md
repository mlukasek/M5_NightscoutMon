### M5Stack Nightscout Monitor

M5Stack is small development kit based on ESP32. It is in a nice plastic box, equipped with color display, micro SD card slot, 3 buttons, speaker and internal battery. It is great to monitor and display something, so I used it to monitor my daughter's glycemia. It is nice, comfortable and cheap solution.

We use Abbott Freestyle Libre, together with MiaoMiao transmitter. It transmits the glycemia values to her mobile phone (we used to use Spike on iPhone, but you can also use Tomato on iPhone or xDrip, Glimp and more on Android). The daughter’s mobile phone then sends data to the Nightscout, where we (parents) watch it using the web application or a mobile phone (Spike, Nightscout, …). We use the small M5Stack monitor with my software to monitor the glycemia during nights in our sleeping room, my wife has one in the kitchen and we take one always on our trips. It has different backlight intensity for night usage and alarms for hypo/hyper glycemia situations.

**In short it displays information from Nightscout site and provides visual and sound alarms if needed.**

Some people were asking for the software. I am not a professional programmer, I am a hardware engineer, but I work more with tables, numbers and e-mails recent years, so I was a little bit shy about the code. As there is quite a lot of people interested in something that shows current values and makes alarms during nights, I decided to release the code as an Open Source.

If you know what to do with it, just download the code, modify it any way it suits you and use it in M5Stack. If you do not know how to handle the source code, just find someone who can. It is easy, just open it in Arduino IDE, download M5Stack libraries, Arduino JSON library and build it to your M5Stack. M5Stack is in more versions, the Core is just enough. The code does not use any features of the higher models. The official M5Stack store is here https://m5stack.com/products/basic-core-iot-development-kit. The current price is about 27.95 USD (9 February 2020). You can also buy it on Aliexpress https://www.aliexpress.com/item/M5Stack-Official-Stock-Offer-ESP32-Basic-Core-Development-Kit-Extensible-Micro-Control-Wifi-BLE-IoT-Prototype/32837164440.html or elsewhere.

**You will need a microSD card.** It has to be formatted to FAT32 format and you have to put at least M5NS.INI file with configuration to the root of the microSD card. It is a good idea to put M5_NightscoutMon.jpg files to the SD card root too. You can replace M5_NightscoutMon.jpg with any 320x240 pixels picture if you want to customize your experience.

**You have to update M5NS.INI file to your requirements. As a minimum requirement you will need to update your Nightscout URL and your WiFi SSID and password.**<br/>
<br/>

### The syntax of M5NS.INI configuration file

### Display

There are currently 3 display pages, that can be changed by a short press of the right button. The button does not work when the device communicated with Nightscout (small blue WiFi icon is displayed).

**Page 0 - default page**  
What you see on the display is a matter of your M5NS.INI and Nightscout configuration. By default you will see current time, date and user name from config file in upper left corner. You will see IOB (Insulin On Board) an COB (Carbs On Board) values bellow the name. Right from the IOB/COB value is current BG delta (difference from the last reading, trend where the BG is going). Box with time difference from last valid data from Nighscout is displayed in upper right corner. Delay of 5 mins is OK and the box has grey color, 5-15 mins is warning and the box will have white background, more than 15 mins without a valid data is error and the box background will be red. There is also possibility to set sound warning on data delay in M5NS.INI.

Glycemia (BG) value and its direction are bellow the basic information. There is a mini graph created from 10 last BG values right of the glycemia value. The mini graph shows only values in range 3-12 mmol/L (48-216 mg/dL) and values bellow/above this will be displayed on mini graph as the min/max values.

There are also icons in upper side of display. Plug or battery icon displays battery status (on newer devices only). Red clock indicated silent "snooze" mode activated. Grey or yellow (more than 5 errors) shows that there are errors in error log (last page). Blue WiFi icon in 2 sizes (2 different queries) indicated that MStack is downloading data from Nightscout.

Last line contains icons for buttons or data source or Loop information (depending on M5NS.INI key "info_line").  

**Page 1 - simple page with large BG value**  
Long distance visible page with large BG value and larger clock. Top line contains current time, icons, delta value a BG direction arrow.

Bottom info line is the same as on page 0.

**Page 2 - analog clock with temperature and humidity**  
Large analog clock with date. BG value in top left corner with time difference from the last reading. BG delta value in top right corner and arrow pointing chinge direction bellow it.

This screen contatins environmental values form DHT12 sensor. Requires ENV Unit or BTC Standing Base connected to MStack. The temperature is in lower left corner and humidity in lower right corner. Temperature unit can be set in M5NS.INI.

Bottom info line is the same as on page 0.

**Error Log page**
Displays last 10 record errors and total number of errors record since last restart. Occasional communication errors, such as "timeout" or "connection refused" are normal and happen sometimes due to WiFi and internet connection and Nightscout site status. If you have a lot of errors every few minutes, consider to move your M5Stack to a different place or extend WiFi signal.  
<br/>

### Buttons

The **left button** changes the backlight in the 3 steps defined in M5NS.INI file.

The **middle button** snoozes M5Stack for defined time to prevent alarm or warning sound. You can "snooze" it even before the alarm is activated. Snooze active is indicated by red clock icon in status icon area.

Short press of the **right button** switches display pages. Long press (4 seconds) puts M5Stack to the sleep as it is a little bit tricky to double click standard red power button.  
<br/>

### Battery

Battery icon feature works only on newer M5Stack units. Here are my battery measurements and battery icon statuses:

| internal battery total                   |  43 min |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------: |
| plug icon _(full charge or plugged in)_  |   1 min |
| gray full battery icon                   |  13 min |
| white 2/3 battery icon                   |  20 min |
| yellow 1/3 battery icon                  |   8 min |
| red empty battery icon                   |   1 min |

---

| extended battery total                   |  7h 49 min |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------: |
| plug icon _(full charge or plugged in)_  |        53m |
| gray full battery icon                   | 2 h 59 min |
| white 2/3 battery icon                   | 1 h 55 min |
| yellow 1/3 battery icon                  | 1 h 48 min |
| red empty battery icon                   |     14 min |
| extended battery total 7:49 hrs:min      |       time |

### Installation and support

Installation can be done by download or git clone the code to the Arduino IDE environment. You have to download ESP32 board and M5Stack libraries, Arduino JSON library and build it to you M5Stack.

Another easier possibility is to download latest [M5Burner release](https://github.com/mlukasek/M5_NightscoutMon/releases). It is Windows executable with binary M5Stack firmware included. Just unzip it, start the M5Burner.exe, choose COM port where your M5Stack is connected and burn the firmware. Simple. Remember to add you microSD card with M5NS.INI configuration file.

There is a Facebook group [M5STACK NIGHTSCOUT](https://www.facebook.com/groups/606295776549008/) where you can get support and installation guides in several languages prepared by members of the M5Stack Nightscout community. Please check the [Files section](https://www.facebook.com/groups/606295776549008/files/) first and search the group before asking questions. A lot of questions have been answered already. Big thanks to Patrick Sonnerat, Didier Frétigné, Peter Leimbach and more...

### VSCode & Platform.IO Development

* You can use VSCode & Platform.IO besides Arduino IDE for development.
* For development use free [Visual Studio Code](https://https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Install Platform.IO addon in VSCode:
  * open `Extensions` from left sidebar
  * search for `Platform.IO` in extension search bar
  * click green `Install` button and wait till it is installed
* Unpack the M5_NightscoutMon_PlatformIO.zip to PlatformIO projects folder.
* Copy the latest sources from GitHub root to PlatformIO project src folder (overwrite) and rename M5_NightscoutMon.ino to M5_NightscoutMon.cpp (the .zip dows not have to be updated to the latest version).
* You can open project directly from VSCode `File -> Open folder...` menu, or from `PIO Home` with `Open project` button.
* Project is already configured for Platform.IO & VSCode. During build it will download and configure all dependencies.
* To **build** project press `PlatformIO: Build` button (it is white check mark icon `âś“` on the blue bottom toolbar)
* To **upload** your project to the m5stack board:
  * Connect your board via USB-C cable to your Laptop/PC
  * press `PlatformIO: Upload` button (it is white right arrow icon `â†’` on the blue bottom toolbar)
